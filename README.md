# R-universe: IsadoreNabi

Welcome to this blog! This space is dedicated to sharing statistical tools and methods that I develop and find necessary during my research in Marxist Political Economy in particular, and Philosophy of Science in general.

My worldview and approach to science are grounded in Classical Marxism, drawing from the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mandel, Rosdolsky, Luk√°cs, Gramsci, Haldane, Oparin, and others. This theoretical framework informs not only the questions I ask but also how I approach methodological and analytical challenges in my research. The tools, code, and techniques I share here emerge from practical research needs, and I hope they prove useful to others working in similar areas or anyone interested in statistical applications within critical social science research.

This blog is a derivative of my main blog at **www.marxistphilosophyofscience.com**, where I explore broader theoretical and philosophical questions. Here, the focus is more technical and methodological, complementing the theoretical discussions with practical computational tools.

Feel free to use, adapt, and build upon anything you find here. Science, after all, is a collective endeavor.
